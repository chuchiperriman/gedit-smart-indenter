Milestone 3
-----------

* Fix problems with c indentation
[ ] Problem with an if without braces:
	if (asdfasdf)
		something ();
		the cursor goes here instead of in the if indent
[ ] Problems with else:
	else
	asdfasdf(); ---- Needs tab
[X] The region indentation in large files kills all the system!
[ ] The indentation works inside a comment
[ ] Problems in switch:
	case 1:
	sdfsd(); ---- It needs a tab
	break; ---- It needs a tab
	default:
	sdfasdfasdf(); ---- It needs a tab
[ ] Indenting regions: Inserts tabs in empty lines (it is wrong)
[ ] Insert a tab in this case ???:
	text_value =
	gtk_text_buffer_get_text (buffer, &start_iter, &end_iter, TRUE);
[ ] In region indentation, does not consume all the CPU if the selection is big
	

* Better python indentation
[ ] Relocate functions (def)
[ ] Relocate class
[ ] Relocate except
[ ] Relocate else
[ ] Relocate elif
